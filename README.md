# Servo App - Google Maps API

## 

# A google maps API based app that conveys information of petrol stations around Australai

This was project 3 of our General Assembly sofware engineering intensive which is a client driven app focused on using the Google Maps API to interact with a server side sql database, housing data of over 5000 petrol stations Australia wide. The app includes several features that interact with the current map location including the following:
* information spotlight of a random petrol station
* stats of the various petrol station owners/companies
* latitude and longitude display
* the local time
* weather information
* information about 10 'nearby' petrol stations.

# Project Planning and Problem Solving 

This was a group task with a focus on team / pair coding and file managment through github. A lot of the set up tasks including setting up the MVC file structure, inital html layout and key milestones where completed as a team of 4. Many of the features were then developed by pairs and in some instances individually, with regular pull request and the rebasing of local repos. 

Part way through the project the code was refactored to maintain or more logical and comprehendable structure seperating each feature (or the key functions of that feature) into a seperate file, with a initialisation client file.

# Bugs to Fix
- Refactor the Map feature itself to seperate out the 'center map' and 'weather' function 
- fix the 'nearest' feature to actually show near by petrol stations. 

# Take-aways 
- Github file managment, working on individual branches, pull requests and merging branches
- Google Maps API familiarity
